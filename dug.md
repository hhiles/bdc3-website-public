teaser: Dug's focus on searching data is semantic search. With Dug, “relevant” is defined as having a basis in curated, peer reviewed, ontologically represented biomedical knowledge. Given a search term, Dug returns results that are related based on connections in ontological biomedical knowledge graphs. 
service: Dug applies semantic web and knowledge graph methods to improve the FAIR-ness of research data.

- Search over dbGaP variables organized by concept
- Discover Dug's automatically harmonized results, as well as manually harmonized results (such as the TOPMed phenotype concept)
- Find other relevant ontological terms to your original search connected through external manual curation efforts (e.g. TOPMed) or automatically through the annotation process
- View knowledge graphs displayed by TranQL queries that span ROBOKOP, ICEES, and other reasoners
- Explore linked concepts contextualized within knowledge graphs to understand Dug's unique insight and "thought process"
- Bookmark concept searches to save for later browsing
- Link to concept search results to share with colleagues

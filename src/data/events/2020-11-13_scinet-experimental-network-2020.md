  title: Supercomputing 2020 — SCinet Experimental Network (XNET) Session
  description: The Experimental Networks Team (XNet) engages partners in research, education, and industry to facilitate high-performance networking experiments during the SC Conference. These experiments often span multiple years, and the results serve to push the boundaries of network technologies and set the stage for SCinet’s continuous evolution to meet the network-intensive needs of the HPC community during SC. FABRIC leadership team members. Ilya Baldin and Inder Monga will discuss FABRIC testbed and experimental networks.

  description: "Experimentation has played an important role in advancing research in computing and networking. Although simulation is an important tool for studying and analyzing the behavior of new protocols and algorithms, it is essential that new research ideas be validated on real systems and testbeds. This workshop brings together researchers and technical experts to share experiences and advance the state of the art in experimental research in areas such as networking, distributed systems, and cloud computing. FABRIC contributor Paul Ruth will present a keynote titled “FABRIC: Enabling Your Impossible Networking Experiments.”"

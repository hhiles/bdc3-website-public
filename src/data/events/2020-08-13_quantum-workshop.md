Photonics has been identified as the key building block for a quantum Internet, providing a network to connect quantum computers and quantum sensors. This workshop is organized to develop plans to establish an NSF Midscale RI-2 national facility for quantum photonics science, engineering and technology.

In this workshop Ilya Baldin will present one of the keynotes titled "The Road to FABRIC" describing some of the approaches that the FABRIC community used and continues to use to make FABRIC a reality. Inder Monga will give a presentation about ESnet testbed, FABRIC and quantum networking technologies.

This conference aims to address the problem and challenge of the very high cost of Experimental mmWave and sub-THz research to democratize and break down the barrier to entry for mmWave and sub-THz wireless experimentation.

In this conference Ilya Baldin will present a short talk titled "Experiences from a Mid-Scale Infrastructure Awardee (FABRIC)" to acquaint the audience with experiences from the first year of constructing FABRIC.

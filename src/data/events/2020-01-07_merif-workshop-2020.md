    title: MERIF Workshop 2020
    description: "MERIF, the Midscale Experimental Research Infrastructure Forum, is an NSF-CISE-funded project, one of whose goals is to look beyond today’s midscale research infrastructure projects for visions of future infrastructures that can support experiments at the frontiers of CISE research areas, both within computer science itself and interdisciplinary."

This workshop is being held on January 7th and 8th. Our own Paul Ruth is presenting _FABRIC: Re-imagining the Internet_.

MERIF is planning a “Future Experimental Research Infrastructures Workshop.” It will bring together researchers in a variety of NSF-CISE and other interdisciplinary areas with experienced midscale experimental infrastructure builders to identify future/evolving research areas and envision community-driven experimental infrastructures to support this research. The goal is to move beyond the current generation of Midscale Experimental Research Infrastructure (see below) projects to provide forward-thinking input to CISE for possible future infrastructure consideration.

We are interested both in re-envisioned experimental infrastructures for current research areas (i.e., infrastructure that is not just scaled up or based on evolutionary changes), and also proposals for infrastructures that will support new frontier and visionary research areas.  Some possible areas of interest include artificial intelligence, data analytics, data intensive applications, city-scale autonomy, advanced wireless (6G and beyond), world-wide real-time sensing, sensing for real world applications (e.g., autonomous vehicle operation/coordination), tomorrow’s clouds, cybersecurity, health monitoring applications, privacy, novel financial systems, non-traditional computation such as quantum computing/networking/security, DNA-based computation/storage, synthetic biology design/synthesis, etc.

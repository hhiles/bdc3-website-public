  title: ERN Architecture and Federation Virtual Workshop
  description: The vision of the federated collaboratories will require the development of many layers of abstractions ranging from hardware, networking, federation architecture, scientific workflows, and domain-specific models and tools to enable collaborative discovery. The ERN Architecture and Federation workshop will present on key topics of interest to the ERN community to generate a discussion and gather information on what the “federated collaboratory” might look like from both a hardware and software perspective as well as what federation should look like as we strive for a seamless collaborative sharing experience.

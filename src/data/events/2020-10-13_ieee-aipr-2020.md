FABRIC creates a unique research infrastructure to enable cutting-edge, at-scale research in networking, cybersecurity, distributed computing and storage, machine learning and AI. We are crafting a rich tapestry of "everywhere-programmable" global nodes equipped with large amounts of network, compute and storage, interconnected by high speed, dedicated optical links connecting FABRIC to specialized testbeds (5G/IoT PAWR, NSF Clouds), HPC, science facilities and the Internet.

In the keynote, Anita Nikolich will give a high-level introduction to FABRIC and some thoughts about the types of "out of the box" security and machine learning experiments weâ€™d like the community to consider.

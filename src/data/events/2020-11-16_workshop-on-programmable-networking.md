The workshop is sponsored by the National Science Foundation (<a href="https://www.nsf.gov/" target="_blank">NSF</a>) and the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (<a href="https://www.nict.go.jp/en/" target="_blank">NICT</a>) of Japan. The workshop will convene leading experts in network programming from each country, and will be held online.

The networking research community has increased its focus on data plane programmability â€“ due to the introduction of programmable switches and software defined radios. These new approaches include changing the way packets are forwarded while in-transit, adding probes or measurements to packets in-flight, or computing on packets at line rates to offload end systems. FABRIC Co-PI Anita Nikolich will be presenting a talk on FABRIC.

The workshop will encourage researcher brainstorming. Workshop findings will be reported to the community and to sponsors.

This talk is titled  _What is FABRIC?_ and will be presented by FABRIC's Anita Nikolich.

Designing, building, and maintaining advanced cyberinfrastructure to support scientific use cases can be challenging. There are numerous items to learn about, and the learning can be never ending. As a community, it is important for all of us to be available to answer questions, propose new ideas, and build upon our collective knowledge.

Starting in 2017 ESnet, in collaboration with the National Science Foundation, began sponsoring semi-weekly talks on engineering and engagement topics. These CI Engineering Brownbag talks are held on Friday afternoons @ 2:00pm ET on Zoom: https://ESnet.zoom.us/j/804696793.

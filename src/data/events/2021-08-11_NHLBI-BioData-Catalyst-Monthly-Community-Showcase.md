On August 11th, join us for an informal, virtual event where you will learn about data access and exploration on BioData Catalyst from team members of PIC-SURE and Gen3. After a demo and presentation from these teams, time will be made available for discussion and to address questions, challenges, and issues you might be facing.

All users are invited to attend, whether you are new to the platform or have been using it for some time. If you are not yet registered for the ecosystem, you can join our community here: https://biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/contact/ecosystem

To get the most out of this opportunity, we recommend including your questions in advance, but we do accept questions and issues during the meeting if time allows. Questions can be specific to this sessionâ€™s topic of data access and exploration, or they can be about any component of the ecosystem you might be curious about.

Submit to our [Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNN2WJaBuJ5noJJGPUjhF-_q-MlTuAdUjnuf5EBjzdsVETww/viewform) any advance questions, challenges you are facing, or issues you have encountered.

We look forward to seeing you!

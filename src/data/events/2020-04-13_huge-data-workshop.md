The Large Scale Networking (LSN) Workshop on Huge Data: A Computing, Networking and Distributed Systems Perspective, held in conjunction with the FABRIC Community Workshop, intends to bring together domain scientists, network and systems researchers, and infrastructure providers, to understand the challenges and requirements of “huge-data” sciences and engineering research needs and explore new paradigms to address the problems associated with processing, storing, and transferring huge data. The workshop will be hosted by FABRIC leadership team members Kuang-Ching Wang, Jim Griffioen and Zongming Fei.
